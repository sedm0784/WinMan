{"name":"Winman","tagline":"","body":"### WinMan\r\nThis is the official site for WinMan (Code name). WinMan is a \"window manager\" for OS X that handles windows, apps and other things using Vim-like expressions. If you are used to and love Vim, then this is the ultimate tool to get rid of the mouse even outside of your text editor.</p>\r\n\r\n### Status\r\nThe app is not released yet, but I hope to get feedback from my [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yror1qNQQQE&list=UUdzFW98T6_g-LdJ0Yo8NdQQ). Leave your feedback in the [issue-tracker](https://github.com/sennah911/WinMan/issues).\r\n\r\nI will eventually release a beta, it may or may not be private, contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/hannesr) if you would like to get early access and help out finding the bugs.\r\n\r\nI haven't decided weather or not I will make this open source and rely on donations.\r\n\r\n### Donations\r\nIf you like the idea of WinMan, please consider donating a small amount of bitcoin and I will be forever grateful.\r\n\r\nDonations will help me:\r\n* Speed up the development process\r\n* Make a decision weather or not I can make it open source\r\n* Buy coffee\r\n\r\nBTC: 15ZZBwC49AgKNoE9o5rpe8t3a9JiCLwqAe","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
